# FinalProject
This is my latest version of the app I originally started creating. 
As I learned more I wanted to challenge myself.
I utilized bootstrap frameworks to have a working MVT django project.
I incorporated what I've learned about django rather than using flask frameworks. 
The app is a simple todo list that uses CRUD methodology.
Post requets are sent to the index page which updates the database of tasks that need to be completed. 
Delete request will remove tasks from the index page.
Update requests will mark the task as completed if the user choses. # final_test
